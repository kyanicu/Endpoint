Primary Objectives:
	Objective instructions are line specific so fill out the template below and paste everything below the dashes into a new file.
	Start each primary objective with an id and underscore like so: 1_tempObjective. The number denotes the order they'll get loaded
	in the game and the name after the underscore is the name that will appear on the objectives screen.
	Anything you write after the icon type line will be treated as additional description and will be displayed under the objective 
	description on the objectives overlay.
	Put all of these folders in the Primary Objectives folder.
