Dialogue Files:
	Dialogue instructions are line specific so fill out the template below and paste everything below the dashes into a new file.
	Give each Dialogue file a unique name so that it is easily to pick which file was meant for where when we start implementing
	story and dialogue into the game. Make sure to separate out your dialogue into lines like how you want it to be read on screen.

Speaker: ADAM
Icon type: null
This is just a simple dialogue test.
Hopefully this gets read on a separate line.
Did it work??
