Secondary Objectives:
	Objective instructions are line specific so fill out the template below and paste everything below the dashes into a new file.
	Start each secondary objective with an id and underscore like so: 1_tempObjective. The number denotes the order they'll get loaded
	in the game and the name after the underscore is the name that will appear on the objectives screen. Numbers [1-2] are the main side 
	objectives while [3-6] are the standard side objectives in each area (ie kill this many unique enemies).
	Make sure only file numbers [1-2] have a description and icon type. Files [3-6] should have an objectives count but be sure to still
	include all the lines. Because secondary objectives are Sector-specific, make sure they are placed in their correct folders
