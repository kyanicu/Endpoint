Lore Files:
	Lore Entryinstructions are not line specific so whatever you write in a file is what you will see on-screen. However, make sure to follow 
	proper naming conventions and hierarchy placement:
		The name of the entry file will appear on a button on the righthand side of the database overlay
		The name of the folder of the entry file will be name of whatever entry this article belongs to
		The name of the folder where the folder of this entry file is contained in will be the category that this type of entry falls into


So for example, the article "Package Details" gives details about the NJMP Network Jump so it can be found in the "NJMP Network Jump" folder. 
Since NJMP Network Jump is an upgrade, the "NJMP Network Jump" folder goes in the UPGRADES folder
