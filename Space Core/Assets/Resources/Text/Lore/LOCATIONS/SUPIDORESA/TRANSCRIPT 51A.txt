INTERROGATOR: There’s no way you were actually expecting to infiltrate the Supidor undetected, were you?

SUBJECT: You would be surprised.

INTERROGATOR: What do you mean?

SUBJECT: It’ll take a while to explain...

INTERROGATOR: You aren’t going anywhere anyway.
SUBJECT: Fine.

SUBJECT: For years, we have been preparing something incredible. Something to show the System the might of the republic. It would be difficult for a weak man like you to understand or even believe.

SUBJECT: The spies on Luna saw the final piece. It was everything we would need to make Solaris a reality. Unfortunately, it was temporarily in your possession.

INTERROGATOR: What was it?

SUBJECT: The Solar Reactor, what else?

INTERROGATOR: How the fuck-

SUBJECT: They sent us in to retrieve it, right here.

INTERROGATOR: But you got caught.

SUBJECT: I did. My colleagues did not.

INTERROGATOR: Fuck.

SUBJECT: They had no trouble getting past the automated defenses. You know they’re nothing compared to the bots we deal with in training?

SUBJECT: As we speak, they’re sending the data back home. They’re integrating the tech into Solaris.

SUBJECT: So you see, it was fully our intention for me to get caught. This is exactly where I wanted to be.

INTERROGATOR: I need to report this. I have to go.

SUBJECT: Any moment now, Solaris will be completed. And it will strike with the might of the Union’s hammer.

*long pause*

INTERROGATOR: Have you been lying this entire time?

SUBJECT: Of course. I’ve already told you idiots that I’m defecting.
