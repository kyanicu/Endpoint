Another report from an anonymous defector has confirmed suspicions of illegal genetics experimentation in the Venusian greenhouses.

Is this another attempt at creating Earth fauna that can survive the Venusian wilds? Or is the Soviet state deperatly trying to replicate the success on Europa?

Most experts agree with the Coalithion's stance to push sanctions on the responsible parties.
